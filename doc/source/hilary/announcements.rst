=======================================

* 4 October 2018

I am looking forward to teaching you part I of numerics this term. The course has a website:

https://mpecdt.bitbucket.io/

with everything that you will need on it. Rather than use the video link to deliver lectures, I have made videos of lectures which you can access from the website. Classes will be on Wednesdays at Reading. You will be working on a Python programming assignment during classes. The assignment and deadlines are also on the website.

There are two versions of the lecture notes on the website, a "student version" which has gaps in which you should print out. You can then fill in the gaps while watching the videos. There is also a "lecturer version" with the gaps filled in.

There is some reading and videos to watch before our first class on Wednesday 10 October. I would also recommend making a start on the assignment so that you can turn up to the class with questions and make best use of my time.

Please do not wait until classes to ask questions. Please also ask questions by signing up to a discussion cite. You can sign up at:
