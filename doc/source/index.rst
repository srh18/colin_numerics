* `Good Programming Practices <https://www.dropbox.com/s/yba7pj7woyvv7hs/goodCode.pdf?dl=1>`_
    Criteria used for marking code.

* `Lecture notes <https://www.dropbox.com/s/i25akbnyp5ceoy6/PDEsNumerics_2_student.pdf?dl=1>`_
    Print out these lecture notes so that you can fill in the gaps during the videos

* `Lecturer version of the notes <https://www.dropbox.com/s/4bjfzzmc8yix0c2/PDEsNumerics_2_lec_growChew856.pdf?dl=0>`_
    You can refer to these to check your answers (gaps filled in)

* `Discussion site <https://mpecdtnumerics.slack.com>`_
    For asking and answering questions about the course. Use this rather than email if you want a swift response. `Sign up to the discussion site here <https://join.slack.com/t/mpecdtnumerics/shared_invite/enQtNDQ5NjI0MzU5MzE4LTVmMGYwNzY3MDFjYzQ3Y2Y4Zjc4NzBhNDM4Y2Y0MjllODNjYWVlODBlN2ZmYmE5Nzg4MTU5ZWY0NTdjY2E3ZDE>`_

* `Corrections to the notes <https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dwaczxvmrf4mfm/corrections.pdf?dl=0>`_
    If you spot errors in the notes, please report these on the discussion site and I will give you a chocolate for your troubles. The notes will be corrected and a list of dated corrections is available `here <https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dwaczxvmrf4mfm/corrections.pdf?dl=0>`_

* `Assignment for Part I of the Numerics course <https://www.dropbox.com/s/8q9pasqwvcy5gzy/assignment.pdf?dl=1>`_
